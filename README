A simple bash script for rolling RPG style polyhedral dice.
once installed to a suitable location in your shell's $PATH, 
you can simply type:
roll 3d6
and it will print the results of 3 six-sided die rolls, and give the total
last. if you only want the total (useful for scripting), just use the -q
option, eg: roll -q 5d4

UPDATE:
Added rollhex. an even simpler script that rolls 2d6 $1 times, and converts the result to hexadecimal
